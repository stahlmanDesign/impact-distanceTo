This demo shows how to use distanceTo() to calculate the distance between two entities.


#Setup

I use imapct-node with Impact.js games instead of the out-of-the-box PHP solution that comes with Impact.

You will need to add your src/lib/impact folder that your have when you purchase a license.

You can run the files from the build folder, but to see and modify the source code you need to install impact-node:

- Install the impact-node server by typing ```npm install -g impact-node``` and then type ```impact-node serve``` and go to http://localhost:3000
- Does not require ```impact-node``` but is set up for it and is missing some of Impact's tools for building using bake script.
- Dev code changes are seen in localhost:3000.
- To use Weltmeister to go localhost:3000/editor
- To build, type ```impact-node build```</li>
</ul>
