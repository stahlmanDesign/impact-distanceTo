Dreamsong is the an HTML5 game made with the ImpactJS game engine. It uses the impact-node server instead of Impact's built-in PHP solution for the Weltmeister editor and for baking.

#The game

- You are a girl trapped in a dream world. You must find four sacred instruments and defeat the piper to escape the dream.
- Version 0.12.0

#Setup

- Install the impact-node server by typing ```npm install -g impact-node``` and then type ```impact-node serve``` and go to http://localhost:3000
- Does not require ```impact-node``` but is set up for it and is missing some of Impact's tools for building using bake script.
- Dev code changes are seen in localhost:3000. To build, type ```impact-node build```</li>
</ul>
